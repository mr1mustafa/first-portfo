          I like to create stuff. Unfortunately, I can’t play an instrument,
          compose symphonies, sing beautifully, paint spectacular paintings or
          sculpt glorious sculptures. But, when I am behind my screen coding, I
          get this overwhelming feeling of doing some kind of magic. “You’re a
          wizard, Mika”, I hear.

          No matter who you are, you most probably get happy when you achieve
          something. Coding is full of that feeling. It’s about dividing big
          problem into small sub-problems or tasks and solving them one by one.
          I love solving problems and the sense of accomplishment. It’s a
          everyday joy for me. And I have noticed that my colleagues also
          spontaneously cheer aloud when they solve a problem – or swear even
          louder when they don’t. Coding evokes strong emotions. I’m gonna go
          code now.

            I am the master of HTML, CSS and Javascript. I know everything
            needed to make a website function, efficient. I didn't stop with the
            web. I went beyond with most popular Javascript framework called Vue
            JS. I even know the deployment, server and security. I will give you
            100% web solution.

            They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remove web
            developer. I made their website and showed it to them. They liked
            it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming
            Hero.
